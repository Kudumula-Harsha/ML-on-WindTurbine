## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains sensor and environmental readings from wind turbine systems, used to predict the **energy generated (PE)** based on multiple engine and atmospheric parameters.

### 🔹 Feature Description

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **AT** | Ambient / Engine Temperature |
| **V**  | Engine Load (Exhaust Vacuum) |
| **AP** | Engine Power / Ambient Pressure |
| **RH** | Relative Humidity |
| **PE** | Energy Generation (Target Variable) |

## 🧠 Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to build a **machine learning regression model** that predicts the **energy generated (PE)** by a wind turbine based on:

- Engine Temperature (AT)  
- Engine Load (V)  
- Engine Power / Pressure (AP)  
- Relative Humidity (RH)  

This is a **supervised regression problem**.
